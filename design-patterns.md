# Design Patterns

### Overview

As we start to develop in C#, it's important for us to learn about real-world design principles. The refactoring guru website has a [catalog](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog) of important designs to know. You can apply these design patterns to make your code very scaleable, versatile, and ultimately very useful to the team and the school.

### Activity

Divide the patterns amongst yourselves, and study them enough to understand how they could be applied to fit real world problems. Explore each page! There's a lot of really good information on them if you need it, including C# code examples. When everyone is done, meet together and teach them to eachother. Have one application example for each design pattern you learned (you don't need to code it). By the end of this task, every one in the team should know each of them and what they are used for.```
